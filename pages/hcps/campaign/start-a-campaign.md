#### Join Medact

Join Medact as a member and get involved in their work on healthcare charging. They have groups in London and Manchester.

#### Get involved in Docs Not Cops

Docs Not Cops is a group of NHS staff and patients that work to combat racism in the NHS. They believe no one should be afraid to access the healthcare they need, either because they canâ€™t pay or might be punished, and that NHS workers should not be forced to police the people they treat. There are groups in Birmingham, Brighton, Glasgow, Wales, and London. If you want to join a group, or start one where you are, then email DocsNotCops.

#### Start your own campaign

We're encouraging people to start their own Docs Not Cops groups where they are. Let us know if you want to do this and will support you to get going. Have a look at the page on starting your own group.

#### Support the #PatientsNotPassports campaign

Develop a Patients Not Passports campaign in another group that you are a part, such as your local Students for Global Health group, Keep Our NHS Public group, migrant & refugee support group, a group that represents your profession or trade union branch.

#### Use our resources

Check out our resources page for flyers, posters, union motions, advocacy materials and loads of other great stuff.
