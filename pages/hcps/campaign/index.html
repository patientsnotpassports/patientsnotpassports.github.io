The introduction of immigration checks and upfront charging threatens the founding principles of the NHS, as healthcare workers we have a responsibility to ensure that it remains a safe, non-judgemental, and universally accessible space for anyone that needs to use it.

We believe the best way to do this is for healthcare workers and patients work together to demand NHS Trusts fulfil their duty of care, and to force the Government to end charges for the NHS.
