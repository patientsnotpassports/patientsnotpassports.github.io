Unions are a powerful voice in the workplace and we should encourage them to speak out on the things that effect how we work.

#### Discuss the policy in your union meeting

You can ask to use time in the meeting to deliver a short presentation on the negative impact immigration checks and charging will have on you, your ability to do your job, and on your patients. You can use or adapt our Grand Round presentations.

#### Bring a motion to your local branch or national convention

The more branches that pass motions on immigration checks and upfront charging the more the governing bodies of the union have to pay attention and take action. Once you've built support for the motion in your branch use our model motions to help draft and pass a motion opposing the policy.
