Our weekly Support Centre offers our migrant visitors free advice on immigration, accommodation and welfare issues, as well as signposting to other organisations that can help. We also provide a warm welcome, tea and biscuits, and opportunities to socialise and practise speaking English.

Our visitorsâ€™ needs and welfare are our top priority. We always do our best to help while respecting anonymity and listening without judgement in the strictest of confidence.

Drop in and see us:
10:00am-12:30pm every Friday
at The Salvation Army
434 Forest Road
E17 4PY

We are opposite Bus Stop BE. Click here for bus routes.

Thanks to the Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and London and to Cassim Yacoobali for providing expert advice.
