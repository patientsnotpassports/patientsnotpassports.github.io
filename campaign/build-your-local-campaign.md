It's important that your campaign focuses on structural change, whether that is running local campaigns or encouraging healthcare bodies to **support migrants’ access to healthcare** and/or to **publically state their opposition to the Government’s policies**.

**As a general rule, when organising campaigns it can be useful to follow the following outline of steps:**

 * Build a team of individual and organisations with whom you can work
 * Do your **research** and **understand** your targets, find out who has the **power** to change the situation, find **your allies** and shape your demands into **specific asks/solutions** to the problem at hand
 * Take action publically, in a way that **elicits a reaction** from those you are trying to impact or influence. This should include working with the media to ensure your action gets coverage.
 * Create opportunities to **negotiate** with those with the power change the situation. Either in a meeting or by inviting them to a public action.
 * **Evaluate** what you have achieved, **plan** what needs to be done next and **regroup** around the next set of demands or issue.
